[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/oewb6667ul5pl05d?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sekineh/binary-heap-plus-rs)

Enhancement over Rust's `std::collections::BinaryHeap`.

It supports the following features and still maintains backward compatibility.
- Max heap
- Min heap
- Heap ordered by closure
- Heap ordered by key generated by closure

## MSRV (Minimum Supported Rust Version)

This crate requires Rust 1.31.1 or later.

## Note on `BinaryHeap::from_vec()`

Currently, the `From<Vec<T>>` trait is implemented for max heap only.
If you add generic impl for other heaps, the existing code breaks, requires 
slight modification such as type annotation.

To maintain good compatibility with `std` version, `::from_vec()` method was added
for the same purpose.
