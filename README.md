# binary-heap-plus-rs

Improvement over Rust's `std::collections::BinaryHeap`.

This crate requires Rust 1.26 or later.

## What is implemented

It is a prototype design that implements the following variations.

The suffix `_min` refers to min heap.
The suffix `_by` and `_by_key` are analogous to `sort_by` and `sort_by_key`.

### `::new_xxx()`

- `::new()`     // creates a max heap
- `::new_min()` // creates a min heap
- `::new_by(f)` // creates a heap ordered by the given closure `f`
- `::new_by_key(g)` // creates a heap ordered by key generated by the given closure `g`

### `::with_capacity_xxx()`

- `::with_capacity(n)` // creates a max heap with capacity `n`
- `::with_capacity_min(n)` // creates a min heap with capacity `n`
- `::with_capacity_by(n, f)` // creates a heap with capacity `n`, ordered by the given closure `f`
- `::with_capacity_by_key(n, g)` // creates a heap with capacity `n`,  ordered by key generated by the given closure `g`
