Enhancement over Rust's `std::collections::BinaryHeap`.

It supports the following features and still maintains backward compatibility.
- Max heap
- Min heap
- Heap ordered by closure
- Heap ordered by key generated by closure

You can change the line

```
use std::collections::BinaryHeap;
```

to like below.

```
use binary_heap_plus::*;
```

Your code will compile as before unless you use unstable APIs.

This crate requires Rust 1.26 or later.

# Added muthods

## `BinaryHeap::new_xxx()`

- (original) `::new()`     // creates a max heap
- `::new_min()` // creates a min heap
- `::new_by(f)` // creates a heap ordered by the given closure `f`
- `::new_by_key(g)` // creates a heap ordered by key generated by the given closure `g`

## `BinaryHeap::with_capacity_xxx()`

- (original) `::with_capacity(n)` // creates a max heap with capacity `n`
- `::with_capacity_min(n)` // creates a min heap with capacity `n`
- `::with_capacity_by(n, f)` // creates a heap with capacity `n`, ordered by the given closure `f`
- `::with_capacity_by_key(n, g)` // creates a heap with capacity `n`,  ordered by key generated by the given closure `g`

# Changes

## v0.1.6

* Add generic constructor `from_vec()` and `from_vec_cmp()`.
* Refactor other ctor to call above methods.

## v0.1.5

* Add `serde1` feature which adds Serialize/Deserialize

## v0.1.4

* Merge #1) Do not require T: Ord when a custom comparator is provided

## v0.1.3

* README.md tweaks.

## v0.1.2

* Cargo.toml tweaks

# Thanks

- I received many valuable feedback from Pre-RFC thread [1].
  - The current design is based on @ExpHP's suggestion that compiles on stable compiler.
  - DDOtten, steven099, CAD97, ExpHP, scottmcm, Nemo157 and gnzlbg, thanks for looking into the design!
- @ulysseB sent me a first pull request!
- @inesseq contributed feature `serde1`.
